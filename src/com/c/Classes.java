	// As you can see in line 3, the word 'class' is a keyword in Java
	// Classes aren't exclusive to Java (Python has them), but I'm not sure if you've ever used them
	
	// What is a class? Simply, it's a blueprint for an object.
	// An object has
	// 		state (internal information) and 
	// 		methods (series of instructions for internal use or to interact with the outside world)
	
	/** An example class would be a @Pencil */
	
	// Classes also have constructors
	// Constructors construct the object from the class's blueprint.  Sometimes there's nothing needed
	// to be done during construction time.  Other times there's state that needs to be set at construction
	
	// Take a look at Pencil now
